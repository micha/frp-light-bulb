# nim

This is a ClojureScript application built with
[HLisp](https://github.com/tailrecursion/lein-hlisp) and
[Javelin](https://github.com/tailrecursion/javelin).

## Development

* Install [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)
* Run `lein deps` to fetch and install dependencies
* Run `lein hlisp autocompile`.  This continuously compiles the ClojureScript sources.
* HTML and JavaScript files will be created in the `resources/public/` directory.
